## By Technique

### Hash Table {#idx-hash-table}

Problems utilizing hash tables for efficient lookups:

1. [Two Sums I](#two-sum-1) - Easy - LeetCode 1

**Concept**: Hash tables provide O(1) average-case lookup time, making them ideal for complement search problems.

---

### Recursion {#idx-recursion}

Problems that use recursive approaches:

1. [Balanced Binary Tree](#balanced-binary-tree) - Easy - LeetCode 110

**Concept**: Recursion \@ref(recursion) solves problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems.

---

### Depth First Search (DFS) {#idx-dfs}

Problems using depth-first traversal:

1. [Balanced Binary Tree](#balanced-binary-tree) - Easy - LeetCode 110

**Concept**: DFS \@ref(dfs) explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

---

### Two Pointers {#idx-two-pointer}

Problems using the two-pointer technique:

1. [Two Sums I](#two-sum-1) - Easy - LeetCode 1 (alternative solution for sorted array)

**Concept**: Two pointers help reduce O(n²) brute force solutions to O(n) by traversing from both ends.

---

## By Data Structure

### Array {#idx-array}

Array-based problems:

1. [Two Sums I](#two-sum-1) - Easy - LeetCode 1

---

### Tree {#idx-tree}

Tree-related problems:

1. [Balanced Binary Tree](#balanced-binary-tree) - Easy - LeetCode 110

**Related Concepts**: Binary Search Tree \@ref(bst), DFS \@ref(dfs), BFS \@ref(bfs)
